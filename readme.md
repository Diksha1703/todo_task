# Todo App API

## Summary
The Todo App API is a backend application designed to manage daily tasks efficiently. This API allows users to register, log in, create, update, and delete their tasks. It also includes features like email reminders for upcoming tasks, JWT-based authentication, and role-specific actions. The project uses modern Node.js practices and ensures a well-structured codebase with separate folders for routes, controllers, middlewares, and services.
